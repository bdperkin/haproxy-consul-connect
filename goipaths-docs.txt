zvelo.io/ttlru,Package ttlru provides a simple&#44; goroutine safe&#44; cache with a fixed number of entries,Package ttlru provides a simple&#44; goroutine safe&#44; cache with a fixed number of entries. Each entry has a per-cache defined TTL. This TTL is reset on both modification and access to the value. As a result&#44; if the cache is full&#44; and no items have expired&#44; when adding a new item&#44; the item with the soonest expiration will be evicted.  It is based on the LRU implementation in golang-lru:
